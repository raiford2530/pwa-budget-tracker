## Description  
A progressive web app created to track and store a user's financial transactions and visualize their spending over time. Transactions can be entered while the app is online or offline. If entered while offline, the transaction will be stored in the database when the app is back online. The app was created using HTML and CSS for the frontend. The backend was created with Node.js and MongoDB along with several node packages including express, mongoose, and compression.
